abstract: Take-home naloxone (THN) programmes have been associated with reductions in opioid-related mortality. The Scottish Government commissioned the 'How to save a life' (HTSAL) mass media campaign to increase awareness of drug-related deaths and how to respond to an overdose and increase the supply of THN. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the campaign on the supply of THN.
