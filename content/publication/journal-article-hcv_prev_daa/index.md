abstract: 'There has been little empirical evidence to show the real world impact of scaling‐up direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) treatment among people who inject drugs (PWID) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) viraemia at a population level. We aimed to assess the population impact of rapid DAA scale‐up to PWID delivered through community services – including drug treatment, pharmacies, needle exchanges, and prisons – in the Tayside region of Scotland, compared with Greater Glasgow & Clyde (GGC) and the Rest of Scotland (RoS).'
