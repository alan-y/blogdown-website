abstract: 'This study compared mortality rates for patients treated for hepatitis C in the era of direct acting antivirals with the general population. Mortality rates among people successfully treated for hepatitis C in the era of interferon-free, direct acting antivirals are high compared with the general population. Drug and liver related causes of death were the main drivers of excess mortality.'
