The Report was prepared by a writing committee stemming from Scotlandâ€™s National HIV PrEP
Coordinating Group. It has been written on behalf of the National Coordination Group and its subgroups (see Appendix 1 of the report for details).  
  
My main contributions to the report were to chapter 5: Evaluating the Impact of HIV PrEP.
