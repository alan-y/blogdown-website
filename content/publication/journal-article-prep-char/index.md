abstract: 'We compared sociodemographic characteristics of individuals diagnosed in the period before and after PrEP implementation, and determined the proportion of potentially preventable infections with the sexual health clinic–based PrEP delivery model used. The sexual health clinic–based national PrEP delivery model appeared to best suit men who have sex with men and white indigenous individuals but had limited reach into other key vulnerable groups. Enhanced models of delivery and HIV combination prevention are required to widen access to individuals not benefiting from PrEP at present.'
