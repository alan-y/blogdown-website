<p>I suppose this is my <em>hello world</em> post – I’ve never been good at getting my messages out there (I’m minimally active on social media, etc) but this is part of my attempt to rectify that a little. I have wanted to start a blog for a long time and in fact, I previously started one but failed to keep it going (hopefully this time it’ll be different!). I had called that one ‘Quietly Analysing’ which was mostly inspired from a quote by Ian Hacking in 1936.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The quiet statisticians have changed our world - not by discovering new facts or technical developments but by changing the ways we reason, experiment and form our opinions about it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s still one of my favourite quotes about statistics but I won’t be continuing with that name as this will be more of a personal/professional website for myself. That blog no longer exists so this is effectively a new start for me. I intend to use this website as a place where I can refer others to my academic and analytical work/projects (e.g. at conferences and for current/future employers) but also as a place where I can write up things to aid my own learning and share with others. Occasionally I may write something personal. This point about writing is important as I’ve always felt that I need to get better at writing so hopefully just trying to do this more will help me improve.</p>
<p>As part of this, I am also hoping to contribute more as a member of the R community – a community that I have always found to be warm, friendly and welcoming. Since I am from Scotland I have to give a particular mention to <a href="http://edinbr.org">EdinbR</a>, who have been doing a great job of promoting R in Scotland (and I have to shamefully admit that I haven’t been able to be a part of as much as I wish).</p>
<p>I am still fairly new to using web tools so still count myself as a beginner in this area and I’m basically learning as I go. Therefore, I really have to acknowledge some people who have created amazing tools and resources that have helped me immensely in getting this website up and running. I am very grateful to <a href="https://yihui.name/en">Yihui Xie</a> for creating <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown">blogdown</a> (and so many other fantastic tools such as <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">RMarkdown</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org">bookdown</a>) which I am using to create this website; to <a href="https://georgecushen.com">George Cushen</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic">Hugo Academic template</a>; to <a href="https://alison.rbind.io">Alison Presmanes Hill</a>, <a href="https://amber.rbind.io">Amber Thomas</a> and <a href="https://lmyint.github.io">Leslie Myint</a> for their useful tips in setting up with blogdown and the Hugo Acadmic template.</p>
