<p>I’ve been a Nadal fan for a long time – right back to the days of the <a href="https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-features/t365-recall-when-the-pirate-pants-wearing-rafael-nadal-came-of-age-on-clay">pirate-pants</a> so yeah, really a long time. In all this time, Rafa has never been ahead in the grand slam race vs his biggest rivals… but that finally changed after the 2022 Australian Open! The win there was unexpected and came out of nowhere. The final against Medvedev has to go down as one of the best comebacks ever.</p>
<p>It’s already been <code>as.Date("2022-02-13") - as.Date("2022-01-30")</code> (14 days) since he won that record 21st grand slam so I thought it has to be about time to do something to mark the achievement. Something that’s been on my list of things to learn is <a href="https://gganimate.com">gganimate</a> which is a very cool R package so I thought I’d take the opportunity here. My goal is to create an animated barplot, showing Rafa on top at the very end.</p>

<h2>Getting the data</h2>
<p>I started by using <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-09/grand_slams.csv">this data on grand slam wins</a> from <a href="https://www.emilykuehler.com/portfolio/barchart-race">this blog post by Emily Kuehler</a> and filtering for just the data on the big 3 male players: Nadal, Djokovic and Federer. Since the grand slam data there does not go all the way up to the 2022 Australian Open, I had to manually add that in by looking up the required information on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and binding that to the end.</p>

<h2>Data processing</h2>
<p>I had to do a bit of general data wrangling (isn’t this always the case unfortunately?) to set things up for gganimate. This is all fairly standard stuff so I’ll just show the code below but one thing to note is that for the rank order (<code>current_rank</code>) of the players at each time point, I sorted ascending on <code>rolling_win_count2</code> rather than descending (as would seem more logical to get the ranking by most slams) because when you use <code>ggplot2::coord_flip()</code>, it puts the highest value (lowest rank) at the top of the graph – so essentially I set it up so that rank 3 is the best and rank 1 is the worst.</p>

<p>Next I prepared some cartoon faces for the 3 players to go on the ends of the bars and stored these on Github so they can be loaded into R with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/ggimage">ggimage</a> package. I won’t go into much detail on the image processing side but the online tools I used to help with this are all in the references section of this blog post.</p>

<div id="gganimate" class="section level2">
<h2>gganimate</h2>
<p>Firstly I’ll mention that for the gganimate package to work well, you’ll also need to install the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gifski/index.html">gifski</a> package. To get things ready for the animated plot in <code>plot_df</code>, I just had to make a couple of minor manipulations. Then everything up to the use of <code>transition_states()</code> in the code below is standard ggplot2 code except maybe the use of <code>geom_image()</code> to add the cartoon faces to the end of the bars (note that I subtract 0.5 from <code>rolling_win_count</code> as the function doesn’t seem to have a <code>nudge_y</code> argument even though it has one for <code>nudge_x</code>) and the use of <code>{closest_state}</code> in the subtitle – this tracks the variable that the animation transitions over which for me, is <code>yr_slam</code>, i.e. the combination of year and grand slam name. The fill colours are from <code>scale_fill_hue()</code> but manually picked so that the fill colour of each player’s bar matches their favourite surface.</p>
<p>For <code>transition_states()</code>, the <code>transition_length()</code> is the relative length of the transition and <code>state_length()</code> is the relative length of the pause at the states (I stole this from the help page); I set <code>wrap = FALSE</code> as I don’t want the last state to transition into the first when looping the animation. I am not sure how much difference the <code>ease_aes("quadratic-in-out")</code> makes here to be honest but that’s what I used. In general I know this function is for messing around with the effects applied to how frames/states transition into one another. <strong>If somebody can give me a good layman’s explanation of these functions, I’d be grateful if you can do so in the comments.</strong></p>
<p>In the <code>animate()</code> function, I set <code>nframes = 500</code>. Some things to note here are that the default is only 50 frames so if you have more than 50 states (and I do as I have more than 50 year-slam combinations) then you need to set this to a larger number but this number should be <em>suitably</em> larger so the animation looks smoother. I set <code>end_pause</code> to 30 frames so that it pauses at the end for a little bit. Finally I applied very specific <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> as I wanted to add something to the end of the animation which happened to have these dimensions – that’s a surprise which you will see!</p>
