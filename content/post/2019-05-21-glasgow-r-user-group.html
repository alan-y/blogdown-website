<p>I am very excited to hear that there are attempts to create a brand new <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Glasgow-R-User-Group">R user group in Glasgow</a>! I had just talked in <a href="../post-number-one">Post Number One</a> about my guilt at not having been able to attend <a href="http://edinbr.org">EdinbR</a> as often as I wished but it should be much easier for me to find time to attend a group based in Glasgow. If you are based in (or near) Glasgow and would like to join the R community, this sounds like the place to be â€“ I hope this idea takes off! This is the blurb from their meetup page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This group is for people who use R (or want to start to). This meetup is a first attempt to get together people in Glasgow interested in R, meet and decide how to go about the organisation. There are several R User around the world and would be nice to ave one in Glasgow as well.</p>
