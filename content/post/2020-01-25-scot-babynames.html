<p>I recently saw this <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2020/01/21/name-guess">great post on Nathan Yau’s FlowingData website</a> which <em>guesses</em> a person’s name based on what the name starts with. It also needs you to select a gender and a decade for when you were born before it can guess. Of course, it isn’t really a guess and is really just based on proportions calculated after restricting the data to what has been selected.</p>
<p>It uses data from the Social Security Administration in America so results more specifically apply to the US. I thought it’d be cool to see how it looks for Scottish data which is available from the <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/names/babies-first-names">National Records of Scotland (NRS)</a>. I’ve embedded the Shiny app below into an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp">iframe</a> but you can view the app in it’s own page by going to <a href="https://alan-y.shinyapps.io/name_guess" class="uri">https://alan-y.shinyapps.io/name_guess</a>. I used a little bit of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838607/making-an-iframe-responsive">css to make the iframe <em>responsive</em></a> (resizes based on the amount of screen/window space available). The app is hosted on <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a> on a free account so if nobody visits it for a while, it will no longer be available (unless I restart it). So apologies if you happen to visit this page further down the line and it’s not working!</p>
<p>The R code I used to download and wrangle the data as well as create the Shiny app is provided further down the page. I hope the app is interesting to some people and my acknowledgements again, to Nathan Yau as this is clearly based off his work.</p>

<h2>Downloading the data</h2>
<p>First I identified the webpages from the NRS website that contained the required babynames csv files and then scraped the links to all the csv files with help from the <a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org">rvest</a> package. I created some helper functions (one to grab the csv links and one to read the csv files into R and tidy them up) to use with the <code>map()</code> functions from purrr.</p>

<p>I created the Shiny app by amending the Shiny template available in RStudio as required – all fairly straightforward stuff and nothing fancy involved at all!</p>
