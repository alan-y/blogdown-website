<p>For a piece of work I had to calculate the number of matches that a team plays away from home in a row, which we will call <code>days_on_the_road</code>. I was not sure how to do this with <code>dplyr</code> but it’s basically a ‘grouped sequence’. For this post, I’ve created some dummy data to illustrate this idea. The <code>num_matches_away</code> variable is what we want to mimic using some data manipulation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

sports_df &lt;- tibble::tribble(
  ~team,    ~date,        ~home_or_away, ~num_matches_away,
  &quot;Team A&quot;, &quot;07/10/2022&quot;, &quot;H&quot;,           0L,
  &quot;Team A&quot;, &quot;14/10/2022&quot;, &quot;A&quot;,           1L,

  &quot;Team A&quot;, &quot;28/10/2022&quot;, &quot;H&quot;,           0L,

<p>I firstly came up with a complicated solution for this using a combination of <code>slider::slide()</code> and <code>rle()</code> (run length encoding).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sports_df2 &lt;- sports_df %&gt;% 
  group_by(team) %&gt;% 
  mutate(days_on_road = unlist(slider::slide(rle(home_or_away)$length, ~1:.x)),
         days_on_road = if_else(home_or_away == &quot;H&quot;, 0L, days_on_road)) %&gt;% 
  ungroup()

identical(sports_df2$days_on_road, sports_df$num_matches_away)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>These are some pretty cool functions and it was nice to know <code>rle()</code> existed but I was never really happy with this solution as it seemed overly complex and it’s difficult to understand what the code is doing by simply reading it. So I asked a colleague to try to solve this problem and they came up with a better solution which I’m grateful for! It involves using a combination of <code>group_by()</code> and <code>seq_len()</code> which is a whole lot simpler to understand in my opinion.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sports_df3 &lt;- sports_df2 %&gt;%
  mutate(away = cumsum(home_or_away == &quot;H&quot;)) %&gt;%
  group_by(team, home_or_away, away) %&gt;%
  mutate(days_on_road = seq_len(n())) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  mutate(days_on_road = if_else(home_or_away == &quot;H&quot;, 0L, days_on_road))

identical(sports_df3$days_on_road, sports_df$num_matches_away)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>I hope this is useful for some of you out there coding with R!</p>
