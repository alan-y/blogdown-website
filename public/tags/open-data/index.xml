      <description>I’ve already got lots of rough pieces of R code written as I’ve been exploring/testing various things in the past. A lot of this is currently stored in a pretty disorganised fashion so I think it might be a good idea to start writing these up into blog posts – at the very least, this should make it easier to find things later! To start this process, I am writing a short post here about how to download data from the CKAN API directly into R – CKAN is an open source data portal platform (basically a tool for making open data websites) and the reason I became interested in it is because this is the platform that NHS Scotland has chosen to host their open data.</description>
