      <description>PreambleOpen Data in ScotlandQuerying CKANQuerying with Custom JSONQuerying with SQLConclusions and Further IdeasPreambleI’ve got lots of rough pieces of R code written as I’ve been exploring/testing various things in the past. A lot of this is currently stored in a pretty disorganised fashion so I thought it would be a good idea to start writing some of these up into blog posts – at the very least, this should make it easier for me to find things later!</description>
