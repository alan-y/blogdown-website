      <description>I am very excited to hear that there are attempts to create a brand new R user group in Glasgow! I had just talked in Post Number One about my guilt at not having been able to attend EdinbR as often as I wished but it should be much easier for me to find time to attend a group based in Glasgow. If you are based in (or near) Glasgow and would like to join the R community, this sounds like the place to be â€“ I hope this idea takes off!</description>
