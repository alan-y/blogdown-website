      <description>Downloading the dataShiny AppI recently saw this great post on Nathan Yau’s FlowingData website which guesses a person’s name based on what the name starts with. It also needs you to select a gender and a decade for when you were born before it can guess. Of course, it isn’t really a guess and is really just based on proportions calculated after restricting the data to what has been selected.</description>
