&lt;p&gt;I’ve already got lots of rough pieces of R code written as I’ve been exploring/testing various things in the past. A lot of this is currently stored in a pretty disorganised fashion so I think it might be a good idea to start writing these up into blog posts – at the very least, this should make it easier to find things later! To start this process, I am writing a short post here about how to download data from the CKAN API directly into R – &lt;a href=&#34;https://ckan.org&#34;&gt;CKAN&lt;/a&gt; is an open source data portal platform (basically a tool for making open data websites) and the reason I became interested in it is because this is the platform that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opendata.nhs.scot&#34;&gt;NHS Scotland has chosen to host their open data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is becoming increasingly important for public sector organisations to make their data open. This is clear from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.scot/publications/open-data-strategy&#34;&gt;Scottish Government’s open data strategy&lt;/a&gt;, who believe it not only aids transparency, but should also result in wider social and economic benefits in the long run. The level of open data provision by organisations in Scotland is currently lagging behind other parts of the UK but encouragingly, the situation is improving (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://codethecity.co.uk/2019/02/24/scotlands-open-data-february-2019-an-update&#34;&gt;this blog post by Ian Watt&lt;/a&gt; for more on this). NHS Scotland has contributed to this improvement by launching their open data platform – I will simply refer to this as CKAN from hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the data held on this platform is licensed under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3&#34;&gt;UK Open Government Licence (OGL)&lt;/a&gt; (what you can and can’t do with the data is well described there). Each dataset held on CKAN is assigned a &lt;em&gt;resource ID&lt;/em&gt; which can be found in the ‘Additional Information’ section once you are on a dataset’s page. It is essential to know the resource ID of the dataset you are interested in when you are working with the CKAN API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-05-21-glasgow-r-user-group_files/glasgowR.png&#34; style=&#34;width:50.0%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to hear that there are attempts to create a brand new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/Glasgow-R-User-Group&#34;&gt;R user group in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;! I had just talked in &lt;a href=&#34;../post-number-one&#34;&gt;Post Number One&lt;/a&gt; about my guilt at not having been able to attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://edinbr.org&#34;&gt;EdinbR&lt;/a&gt; as often as I wished but it should be much easier for me to find time to attend a group based in Glasgow. If you are based in (or near) Glasgow and would like to join the R community, this sounds like the place to be – I hope this idea takes off! This is the blurb from their meetup page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group is for people who use R (or want to start to). This meetup is a first attempt to get together people in Glasgow interested in R, meet and decide how to go about the organisation. There are several R User around the world and would be nice to ave one in Glasgow as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
