&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-05-21-glasgow-r-user-group_files/glasgowR.png&#34; style=&#34;width:50.0%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to hear that there are attempts to create a brand new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/Glasgow-R-User-Group&#34;&gt;R user group in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;! I had just talked in &lt;a href=&#34;../post-number-one&#34;&gt;Post Number One&lt;/a&gt; about my guilt at not having been able to attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://edinbr.org&#34;&gt;EdinbR&lt;/a&gt; as often as I wished but it should be much easier for me to find time to attend a group based in Glasgow. If you are based in (or near) Glasgow and would like to join the R community, this sounds like the place to be â€“ I hope this idea takes off! This is the blurb from their meetup page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group is for people who use R (or want to start to). This meetup is a first attempt to get together people in Glasgow interested in R, meet and decide how to go about the organisation. There are several R User around the world and would be nice to ave one in Glasgow as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
